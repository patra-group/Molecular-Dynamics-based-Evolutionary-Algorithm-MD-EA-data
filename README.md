# Molecular-Dynamics-based-Evolutionary-Algorithm-MD-EA-data
This repository contains the data ofMD-EA generated sequence - Radius of gyration (Rg) of a copolymer system.

1. The text files contain the "Sequences" and its "Rg" values for molecular dynamics based evolutionary algorithm (MD-EA).

2. "q" is the composition ratio of 100-mer polymer chain containing A/B ratios, that are as follows:
        q = 20A/80B = 0.25
        q = 40A/60B = 0.66
        q = 50A/50B = 1.0
        q = 60A/40B = 1.5
        q = 80A/20B = 4.0

3. Each text file contains the sequences generated by MD-EA for both "Maximization" and "Minimization" run.

4. If you use this data in your research and publication, please cite this article https://doi.org/10.1002/pol.20220088
